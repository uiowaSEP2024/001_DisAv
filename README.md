# InfiniteFocus

## Introduction

InfiniteFocus is a revolutionary mobile app designed to combat digital distractions and promote productivity and mindfulness. Utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js), this app is crafted to minimize phone addiction and provide users with constructive breaks. Random notifications encourage users to take short breaks, offering activities like physical exercises or calming visuals like a fireplace. The app includes a mobile application for on-the-go tasks, a web app for desktop use, and a Chrome extension that helps monitor and control doom scrolling by redirecting users to productive tasks.
